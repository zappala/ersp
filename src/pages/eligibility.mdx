# Eligibility

ERSP is for students who are just beginning their CS careers and early in their
careers at BYU. To apply you should:

- Be in starting your third our fourth semester at BYU, or be an incoming
  transfer student.
- Not have completed 300-level or 400-level courses
- Be in a major in the CS department

## What if you do not satisfy all eligibility requirements?

If you do not meet these eligibility requirements you may still apply,
especially because this is the first year. You will need to provide an
additional essay discussing why an exception should be made.

We do make exceptions for students (particularly for students in closely related
majors outside the CS department), so donâ€™t be afraid to apply if you think you
have a valid reason for not meeting the above criteria. Some valid reasons might
include starting the major very late or taking courses out of sequence for some
reason.
