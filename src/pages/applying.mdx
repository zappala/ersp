## Preparing and submitting your application

Before you click on the application lin, we recommend that you read the
questions below, prepare your responses in a separate file, and then copy and
paste them into the application. Also be sure to check the
[eligibility requirements](/eligibility) to know if you are eligible to apply.

## Short essay questions on the application

Write a paragraph for each of these:

1. What do you hope to get out of participating in the CSE Early Research
   Scholars Program?

1. One goal of this program is to broaden access to university research to
   students who have historically faced barriers â€” financial commitments, lack
   of role models/community/knowledge of graduate study, first-generation, etc.
   Please describe how your participating in this program would be helpful to
   you in overcoming such barriers.

1. Another goal of ERSP is to promote and support a diverse Computer Science
   community along many dimensions including (but not necessarily limited to)
   gender, race, ethnicity, nationality, socioeconomic status, ability, sexual
   orientation, and first-in-family to attend university. Part of building this
   community involves creating a space where students from minoritized groups
   feel included. Explain your understanding of how being from a minoritized
   group affects a person's experience in CS and how you came about this
   understanding.

1. ERSP is open to students in CS majors who have not taken any upper division
   (300-level or 400-level) CS courses and who will be in the sophomore year.
   The program may also be a good fit for those in their junior year. **If you
   have completed 5 or more Fall and Winter semesters at BYU**, describe why you
   feel that an exception should be made in your case. (Optional, only for those
   who don't meet all of the eligibility criteria.)
