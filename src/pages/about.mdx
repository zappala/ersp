# About ERSP

The BYU Computer Science Early Research Scholars Program (ERSP) is a team-based
research apprentice experience for computer science majors in their second year
of the program.

Students get a chance to learn how to conduct research early in their program of
study, enabling them to better understand the field of computer science and to
consider whether academic research and a graduate degree may be part of their
future path.

Students work in teams of four, and each team is matched with an active research
project in the department. Students learn about research in computer science and
then propose and carry out an independent research project over the course of an
academic year.

Over the course of the program, ERSP groups will attend a research group’s
normal weekly meetings to observe and learn from (and eventually contribute to)
this research group. At the same time, ERSP students attend a weekly support
class with all other students in the ERSP program that helps them learn the
basics of research and make sense of what they are hearing and learning about in
their research groups.

The ERSP was started at [UCSD](https://ersp.eng.ucsd.edu/home), with partners
now at UIC, UC Santa Barbara, Stanford University, and several other
universities.

## ERSP Objectives

- To excite participants through early exposure to research in computer science
  and the challenges facing CS researchers today.
- To teach participants the fundamental skills involved in conducting CS
  research.
- To create a diverse and supportive community within the CSE department, with a
  particular focus on engaging students from groups currently underrepresented
  in computer science including women, African Americans, Hispanics, Native
  Americans and indigenous peoples.

## Overview of the Program

Over the course of a year, ERSP students enroll in two courses. We will work
with students to have both of these courses count for credit in their current
major, whenever possible.

### Winter Term: CS 301R Introduction to Computer Science Research (3 credits)

_Main outcome:_ Completion of a proposal for an original group project

_Activities_: Class discussion, weekly meetings with research adviser and grad
student adviser

_Topics_

- Identifying and formulating research problems
- Reading research papers
- Working effectively in a team
- Literature searching
- Self-guided learning
- Designing research studies
- Data analysis
- Time management, goal setting and activity logging
- Communicating about research, both orally and in written form
- Effective teamwork communication and skills
- Peer review
- Research ethics
- Learning tools/methods for their research project (e.g. online courses,
  tutorials)

### Spring: CS 497R Independent Research (3 credits)

_Main outcome:_ Completion of a group research project, culminating in a poster
session _Activities_: Work on research project, 10 hours per week, joint
mentoring with grad student TA and research faculty

_Mentoring_: Grad student TA meets weekly with each group for an hour, helping
them set goals, choose tasks, organize time, hold them accountable, ERSP central
adviser meets weekly with each team

_Meetings_: How to design and present a poster

## Mentoring

During the course of the program students are dual mentored by a central ERSP
director/adviser and by a research advisor. The central ERSP adviser is usually
assisted by a graduate student assistant ERSP adviser. The diagram below gives
an overview of the overall program structure (the grad student assistant is not
shown in the diagram, but would assist the ERSP Central Adviser with her or his
tasks). The specific role of each adviser is discussed in more detail below.

## Current Research Groups

Currently, the following research groups will be participating in the coming
year. We will add more if possible.

- Ryan Farrell – Fine-Grained Visual Categorization. Training computers to find
  the highly-localized and often subtle characteristics that allow precise
  identification at the level of fine-grained categories.

- Nancy Fulda – DRAGN Lab. DRAGN Lab focuses on neural architectures for
  Conversational AI, in addition to machine learning, neural language models,
  and natural language understanding.

- Amanda Hughes – Crisis Informatics Lab. The Crisis Informatics Lab seeks to
  understand how people use information and communication technology (ICT)
  during crises and mass emergencies, with particular attention on social media.
  AN overarching goal of this research is to inform, design, implement, and
  deploy software systems that improve crisis communications.

- Mike Jones – Advanced Interactive Lab. Builds interactive systems from
  emerging technology. They are currently working on presenting sports motion
  data in the context of the coach-athlete relationship and on mobile phone apps
  that enhance rather than minimize the benefits of hiking.

- Xinru Page – Social Technology and Privacy Lab (STaPL). STaPL is a human
  computer interaction lab that focuses on understanding how people use social
  technologies. We design technologies that facilitate social needs balanced
  against privacy and online safety in areas such as social media, mobile,
  health, and IOT.
